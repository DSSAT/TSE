Potential user,

In case if you are interested in downloading and using the TSE program for optimising cultivar coefficients for DSSAT models can you please send me a short e-mail describing what crop model you are going to use it with and for what purpose.

I am not personally able to test TSE with all available crop models in the DSSAT (with exception of CROPGRO-Soybean, CERES-Wheat, CERES-Maize and IXIM-Maize), since I don’t have enough time and I have to rely on new user to test the program while they are conducting their own studies.

The program has generic algorithm and “theoretically” should work with all crop models available in the DSSAT shell (With the exception of the Phenological events subroutine used for optimisation, because it is still hard coded).

If you write me an e-mail (to: emir_memic@windowslive.com or emir.memic@uni-hohenheim.de) and let me know with what crop model you are planning to use the TSE, I can check it and make sure there are no undesired “bugs” in next TSE version for that specific crop model.
